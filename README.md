### Hi there

- Now this account is mainly for Intel internal projects use, so there will not be too many public commits. There are also some repos during my university career on this account, which have basically stopped maintenance. They should all be free to use, but cooperation projects may need to check the license;
- If there are questions, you can contact my personal email (vencifreeman@outlook.com), but please expect very few responses, thanks for understanding;
- In general I am a hardware biased engineer now. I’m currently working on Intel server platform development, mainly on FPGA/CPLD development, so I use Verilog/SystemVerilog heavily. I also write some C/C++/Python scripts, but mostly for my own play or use;
- I’m currently learning server platform design methodology and the code implementation of various firmware (CPLD, BIOS, BMC, etc.).
